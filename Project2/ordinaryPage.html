                is a stealth action video game. The first one was
                released in 1998.  In 2014 the expanded version of Thief was
                out. In this game the player takes the role of Garrett,
                a master thief. The objective of this game is to sneak
                and avoid fighting with enemies and steal valuable items.
                The player has to play the game very carefully because
                if any noise is made, enemies will become alert.
                In each mission players have to explore more maps and
                find secret paths. One of the best aspects of the game
                is that it has many different endings.</p>
