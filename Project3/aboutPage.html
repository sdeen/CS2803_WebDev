            <h2> About </h2>
            <p> In this game, the player takes the role of Garrett,
                a master thief. The objective of this game is to sneak
                and avoid fighting with enemies to steal valuable items.
                The player has to tactically maneuver in the game because
                if any noise is made, enemies will become alert.
                In each mission players have to explore more maps and
                find secret paths. One of the best aspects of the game
                is that it has many different endings.</p>
