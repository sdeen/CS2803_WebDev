        <h2>Garrett</h2>

            He is the master thief. He has perfect skills for thievery. He is uncatchable and silent in darknesses.

        <h2> Erin </h2>

            Erin is a thief who is acquainted with Garrett.  Her rough tendencies result in her
            frequently killing threats instead of knocking them out,
            which Garrett's does not approve. She is an assassin for hire, as well as a thief.
